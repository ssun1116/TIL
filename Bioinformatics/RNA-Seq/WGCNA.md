**KEY POINTS**

- RNA-seq-based co-expression analysis can be used to assign putative functions to non-coding RNAs and to identify candidates for roles in disease.
- In co-expression networks, hub gene identification has a limited power for identifying targets for follow-up studies. Yet, this can be enhanced by integrated network analyses, which may incorporate GWAS hits, eQTLs, TFBSs, and other data layers.
- Differential co-expression analyses can reveal genes that have different co-expression partners between healthy and disease state
and can help to uncover regulators underlyin gidsease and other phenotypes.
- Methods such as biclustering and Generalised Single Value Decomposition (GSVD) allow the identification of signals/modules unique to specific cancer subtypes, which may serve a purpose in prognosis and for precision medicine

**MAIN TOPIC**

- 유전자들은 따로 존재하는게 아니라 서로 연결되어 같은 기능을 한다.
